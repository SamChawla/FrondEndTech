# JavaScript

- Everything in JavaScript happens inside an `Execution Context`
- Execution Context is divided into 2 Parts:

    |Memory|Code|
    |:---|:---|
    |It is also known as Variable Environment.|It is also known as Thread of Execution|
    |Here variables are divided into Key : Value pairs e.g a : 10, fn : {...}| Here code is evaluated line by line.|

- JavaScript is a `Synchronous` `Single threaded` language.
  - Synchronous: It can perform only one command at a time.
  - Single threaded: It can perform command only in a particular sequence. Once the previous command is completed.
